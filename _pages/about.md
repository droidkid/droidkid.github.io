I am a PhD student at the [Khoury College of Computer Sciences](https://www.khoury.northeastern.edu/), Northeastern University since Spring 2025. I am part of the Data Lab with [Dr. Prashant Pandey](https://prashantpandey.github.io/) as my advisor. 

My research interests are to design data structures and algorithms to build scalable systems, with a focus on modern database systems.

Prior to this, I recieved my Master's degree in Computer Science from the University of Utah in 2024. I was a Software Engineer at Google India, mainly working on [Engineering Productivity](https://landing.google.com/engprod/) at Google Pay and Google Cloud. I received my Bachelor's degree from the [Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra](https://bitmesra.ac.in) in 2016.
