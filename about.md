Hey there! I'm Yuvaraj Karthikeya Chesetti.


I'm currently working at Google as a Software Engineer. I'm an alumni of Birla Institute of Technology, Mesra and a Cottonian from Bangalore. Video games and books are generally what keep me occupied when I'm free.


Welcome to my blog! It's still early days but I hope to put a lot of interesting stuff here.
